#### HELP! Dummy App - HTML & CSS


-----------------------------------------


## What is it?

This was a dummy app that I used to show proof of concept and project flow. HELP! was the final project in my bootcamp.  The actual app was built using MERN. The idea is that users would log in and choose the button that matches their emergency. They would be directed to a page with a map and a list of resources to help with the current emergency.  If they chose to search for something else specifically, they could do so in the search bar. The search bar is not currently functional.
